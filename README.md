# Tasks

We are here to create a modern Tasks-list app by using AngularJS 1.5.x components, ES6 and Webpack bundler.

Follow steps below to bootstrap the application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:angularjs-recipes/tasks.git
cd tasks
npm install
npm run build
```

The application is already launched pointing to `http://localhost:3000/#/`
